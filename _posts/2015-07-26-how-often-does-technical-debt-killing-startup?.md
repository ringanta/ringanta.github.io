title: How Often Does Technical Debt Killing Startup?
---

This post is summary from Hacker News (HN) thread at [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9949664](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9949664). I like definition of technical debt as follow "problems in the code base that make it harder than it should be to do work, whether that work is adding new features, fixing bugs, scaling up, etc".

- Technical debt caused failed acquisition
- Addressing technical debt caused 30% lost net revenue
- The startup that can implement new features quickly because their code base isn't a disaster (less technical debt) is more likely to succeed.
- Technical debt should be managed, but it can't be eliminated
- Correctness vs. completeness spectrum, where correctness is how well the architecture fits the problem, how well edge cases are handled, if it's a service then whether it's built to scale horizontally, etc, and completeness is how shippable the thing is as in are the important features there, are the bugs not too severe, could the thing live in production without causing severe harm, etc.
